/**
 * Functions are simply transformation. it reveives an input and transform them to somthing else.
 * Inputs and Outputs are sets of values.
 * Functions can only map a value from input to only one value to the output universe.
 * Function is Deterministic if : Every time calling a function we're expecting to return the same value.
 * Functions should not have side effects.
 * Functions is called Partial if there are some values in their input universe the the function is not defined for them. 
 * Pure function: has no side effects, deterministic and total.
 * Variables are immutable, we only create new values from old ones.
 * Referential Transparency: you can replace a pure function with its definition
